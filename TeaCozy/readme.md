This is website for a fictional tea shop website. I basically went by the spec
provided for the project but did take a few liberties. I resized the location
main container because I didn't feel that the size in spec suited the look of the remaining components of the page. I also put borders on the images and some of the containers as a felt there was something missing without a border. I'm looking forward to your comments and suggestions on the project.
